# Recipe Finder

This is a simple demo website for randomly selecting recipes using the Perplexity API. Users can filter by cuisine, meal type and vegetarian option.

## Setup

1. Obtain an API key from Perplexity.
2. Open `index.html` and enter your API key in the "Perplexity API Key" field.

The script uses Perplexity's API endpoint:
`https://api.perplexity.ai/recipes/random`.

## Usage

Serve the project with any static web server (no PHP required), or simply open `index.html` in your browser.
